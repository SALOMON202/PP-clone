    >Alien Airforce, AKA Crispin Gray, release their debut EP ‘One’. Crispin,
    former guitarist and songwriter for Daisy Chainsaw, said Alien Airforce was
    born as the result of him wanting to embrace modern technology and being
    able to take complete control of his music again. Daisy Chainsaw, best known
    for their 1992 chart hit ‘Love Your Money’ catapulted Crispin to a world of
    touring and mixing with the rock‘n’roll hierarchy, with the likes of Dave
    Grohl, Eddie Vedder and Marilyn Manson being fans. But he admits that
    sometimes in the early days, his creativity was compromised, saying, “It was
    incredibly frustrating how often one had to accept your work being released
    in a form you didn't like or agree with.”</span
